    "This exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to provide insights on the variables of the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html), which was first introduced by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman in 2020. The dataset is a collection of data about three different species of penguins inhabiting the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station in Antarctica, which wwere collected from 2007 to 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network.\n",

    "For this analysis, we will focus on exploring the data to gain insights on the underlying attributes with the end goal of uncovering patterns and identifying dependencies. We will seek to explore the [correlation between two of the variables](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-it-takes-to-be-correlated-ce41ad0d8d7f), whether they are casual or not.\n",
